# Google Lens Visual Search Integration - Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a Google Lens-like visual search system that finds similar images, related locations, and web sources for OSINT geolocation analysis. The system should function like Google Lens by showing where the uploaded image appears on the internet, finding similar locations, and providing geographic references.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Visual Search Engine Integration

**User Story:** As an OSINT analyst, I want to upload an image and see where it appears on the internet, so that I can find the original sources and related locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL perform reverse image searches across multiple engines
2. WHEN reverse search completes THEN the system SHALL display thumbnail previews of similar images found
3. WHEN similar images are found THEN the system SHALL show the source websites and URLs
4. WHEN I click on a similar image THEN the system SHALL open the source page in a new tab
5. IF no similar images are found THEN the system SHALL display "No similar images found" message

### Requirement 2: Geographic Location Discovery

**User Story:** As an OSINT researcher, I want to see geographic references and location names associated with my image, so that I can identify where the photo was taken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar images are found THEN the system SHALL extract location names from source pages
2. WHEN location names are extracted THEN the system SHALL display them as clickable geographic references
3. WHEN I click a location reference THEN the system SHALL show it on a map
4. WHEN multiple locations are found THEN the system SHALL rank them by relevance
5. IF location metadata exists THEN the system SHALL extract and display GPS coordinates

### Requirement 3: Web Source Analysis

**User Story:** As a digital investigator, I want to see all websites where my image appears, so that I can trace its origin and usage history.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reverse search completes THEN the system SHALL list all source websites
2. WHEN source websites are listed THEN the system SHALL show page titles and descriptions
3. WHEN source analysis runs THEN the system SHALL extract publication dates if available
4. WHEN multiple sources exist THEN the system SHALL sort by relevance and date
5. IF source page contains location data THEN the system SHALL highlight geographic information

### Requirement 4: Similar Location Matching

**User Story:** As a geolocation analyst, I want to find images of similar places or landmarks, so that I can identify the specific location through visual comparison.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN visual search runs THEN the system SHALL identify architectural and landscape features
2. WHEN features are identified THEN the system SHALL search for similar landmarks or places
3. WHEN similar places are found THEN the system SHALL display them with location names
4. WHEN I view similar places THEN the system SHALL show distance and direction if possible
5. IF landmark is identified THEN the system SHALL provide Wikipedia or tourism information

### Requirement 5: Interactive Results Display

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see search results in an organized, visual format like Google Lens, so that I can quickly identify relevant information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search completes THEN the system SHALL display results in a grid layout
2. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show image thumbnails with source info
3. WHEN I hover over results THEN the system SHALL show preview information
4. WHEN results load THEN the system SHALL group them by type (similar images, locations, sources)
5. IF many results exist THEN the system SHALL implement pagination or infinite scroll

### Requirement 6: OSINT-Specific Features

**User Story:** As an OSINT professional, I want specialized tools for image investigation, so that I can gather comprehensive intelligence about the image's origin and context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analysis runs THEN the system SHALL check image for manipulation or editing
2. WHEN metadata exists THEN the system SHALL extract and display all EXIF information
3. WHEN sources are found THEN the system SHALL analyze posting patterns and dates
4. WHEN location data exists THEN the system SHALL cross-reference with mapping services
5. IF social media sources exist THEN the system SHALL identify platform and user context

### Requirement 7: Real-time Search Integration

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want the search to happen automatically when I upload an image, so that I can immediately see all related information without manual steps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I upload an image THEN the system SHALL automatically start visual search
2. WHEN search is running THEN the system SHALL show progress indicators
3. WHEN results start coming in THEN the system SHALL display them progressively
4. WHEN search completes THEN the system SHALL show total results count
5. IF search fails THEN the system SHALL retry with alternative methods

### Requirement 8: Export and Sharing Capabilities

**User Story:** As an analyst, I want to export my findings and share them with my team, so that I can document my investigation results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN results are available THEN the system SHALL provide export options
2. WHEN I export results THEN the system SHALL include all source URLs and metadata
3. WHEN sharing results THEN the system SHALL generate a shareable report
4. WHEN exporting THEN the system SHALL include timestamps and search parameters
5. IF coordinates are found THEN the system SHALL export them in multiple formats (KML, GPX, JSON)
